                        <p>Hey all, my name is Carson Gabler.<br>
                            I am a second year Computer Science major from <strong>Portland Oregon</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Thankfully, I was able to have free time while working this summer. Here are some of the things I did:</p>

                        <p>I <strong>love soccer</strong>. I have played it my whole life
                        <br>I was also able to <strong>work out</strong> with all my friends.
                        <br>I went to visit my glorious kings at Oregon State. <strong>GO BEAVS</strong>
                        <br>I attended a couple <strong>concerts</strong> and <strong>music festivals</strong>.
                        <br>Finally, I was able to <strong>intern</strong> with my local high school and my favorite teacher.
                         Focusing in <em>software development, artificial intelligence, and teaching!</em></p>
